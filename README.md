ResearchPublication DAO
Project Description
ResearchPublication DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization built on the Stacks blockchain that revolutionizes academic paper publishing through blockchain technology. The platform enables researchers to submit academic papers for peer review, incentivizes quality peer reviews through tokenized rewards, and facilitates open access funding for research publications.

The DAO eliminates traditional publishing gatekeepers by implementing a transparent, community-driven peer review system where reviewers are rewarded with native tokens for providing quality feedback. Papers that meet quality thresholds are automatically published, ensuring merit-based publication decisions.

Project Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized, transparent, and incentive-aligned ecosystem for academic research publication that:

Democratizes Research Publishing: Removes barriers imposed by traditional academic publishers and makes quality research accessible to everyone
Rewards Quality Reviews: Creates economic incentives for thorough, constructive peer review through tokenized rewards
Ensures Open Access: Promotes open science by making research freely available while fairly compensating authors and reviewers
Builds Reputation Systems: Establishes transparent, blockchain-based reputation tracking for researchers and reviewers
Accelerates Scientific Progress: Speeds up the publication process through automated quality assessment and community governance
Creates Funding Mechanisms: Enables direct funding of research projects through DAO treasury and community support
